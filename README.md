# hfunk

Collection of useful R functions for everyday data analysis and modeling. These are the functions I find myself using often and that I have not found in other packages. They are usually simple and often just wrappers for base R functions that do not offer full functionaility that I often need. 

The sole reason for turning this list of functions into a package is that it improves reproducibility of data analysis and modeling in my scientific articles. Everyone is welcome to use them under the licence terms.

The package at the moment has only a handful of functions, with time I will put all other functions I regularly use in my reasearch in a nicer form and provide documentation. 


## Install

For now you can install the package from `github` using the `devtools` package. 

    ```R
    install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::install_github("hstojic/hfunk")
    ```
